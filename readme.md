# Hrim

Hrim is a serverless first JavaScript framework for building out APIs. The goal is to build out with serverless infra and overtime switch over to monolith architecture once the request rate hits a stable baseline and use a hybrid model with serverless functions to act as a temporary buffer while more virtual machine instances are provisioned to reduce p99 times where some instances may have a cold start of 2-3 minutes. 

In essence, the goal is to have a framework that is fast, light weight, and modular. Think of a hybrid vehicle you get the benefits of EV(high efficiency during start and stopâ€”and low speed) and ICE(long range).
